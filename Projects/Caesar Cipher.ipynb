    "## What is Caesar Cipher?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) in cryptography.  \n",
    "It is used to encrypt or decrypt messages/texts between two parties.  \n",
    "It is a kind of **Monoalphabetic Substitution cipher.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher) is a simple cipher where some characters of the plaintext are replaced by specific characters to produce the ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encrypt text using classic Caesar cipher, we just shift the alphaber by 3 and substitute the values. For example, A is replaced by D, B -> E, C -> F, and so on, till Y -> B and Z -> C.  \n",
    "Its really simple. Let's have a look at a simple example."

    "## Working Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a simple example.  \n",
    "Our enemy is stationed in a palace in a valley. Unsuspecting of any attach they are enjoying in their palace. Our army is at one of the hill peaks near the valley and our allies are at the other end on the opposite hill.  \n",
    "We want to encrypt the phrase **ATTACK AT ONCE** and send it to our allies on the other side, so that we both can start the attack at the same time and crush our enemy from both sides.  \n",
    "We disregard spaces as we don't have any method to encrypt spaces using the Caesar Cipher, thus, the plaintext becomes **ATTACKATONCE**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To encrypt using the traditional Caesar Cipher, we shift alphabets to the right by 3 places. Thus, we need to make the following changes:  \n",
    "- A -> D\n",
    "- T -> W\n",
    "- C -> F\n",
    "- K -> N\n",
    "- O -> R\n",
    "- N -> Q\n",
    "- E -> H  \n",
    "Making the necessary changes:  \n",
    "plaintext - **ATTACKATONCE**  \n",
    "encrypted - **DWWDFNDWRQFH**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the message is delivered on the other side, our allies (who know how to encrypt and decrypt) can then just reverse shift the alphabet by 3 places to get the message that we sent.  \n",
    "The message they receive: **DWWDFNDWRQFH**\n",
    "They make the following changes:  \n",
    "- D -> A\n",
    "- W -> T\n",
    "- F -> C\n",
    "- N -> K\n",
    "- R -> O\n",
    "- Q -> N\n",
    "- H -> E  \n",
    "Making the changes:  \n",
    "encrypted message - **DWWDFNDWRQFH**  \n",
    "decrypted message - **ATTACKATONCE**\n",
    "\n",
    "The allies then add the necessary spaces, look at the message and launch their attack! Together, we defeat the enemies and have a nice day hanging out at their palace.\n",
